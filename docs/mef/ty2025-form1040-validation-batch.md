# TY2025 Form 1040 validation batch

This is the execution checklist for the agreed build-first gate. It is a plan,
not a record of a current pass. Do not run it until the in-scope implementation
and unsupported-path decisions are settled. The historical 2026-09-26 result
(6,596 passed, 0 failed, 48 ignored) predates the current worktree.

## Scope and preflight

The release scope is the Form 1040 family described in `product_board.md`. Form
1040-NR, 1040-SS, 4868 and dual-status e-file exporters are not release gates,
although their tests may still run as repository regressions. The form-by-form
inventory and any explicit unsupported-path exclusions must be resolved before
the batch. Do not turn an unimplemented filing path into an implicit pass by
omitting its fixture.

Run these read-only checks from the repository root before the batch:

```sh
command -v deno
command -v xmllint
command -v pdftoppm
command -v pdfinfo
test -f .state/research/docs/IMF_Series_2025v5.4/1040x_Schema_2025v5.4/2025v5.4/IndividualIncomeTax/Ind1040/Return1040.xsd
test -f .state/research/docs/IMF_Series_2025v5.4/1040x_Schema_2025v5.4/2025v5.4/IndividualIncomeTax/Ind1040/ReturnData1040.xsd
```

The TY2025 v5.4 return XSDs and all four commands were present on the 2026-09-29
workspace inspection: Deno 2.7.7, `xmllint` with libxml 2.9.13, and Poppler
`pdftoppm`/`pdfinfo` 26.03.0. A filtered MeF Schedule 2 XSD test and a filtered
full-return Single W-2 XSD test each ran with one pass and zero ignored, proving
the local `Return1040.xsd` was used in both test files. The XSD tests use
`ignore: !xsdAvailable`; without the first XSD file, they silently skip. Do not
accept a full batch where those tests are ignored. The IRS schema is structural
validation, not IRS business-rule or ATS acceptance.

## One full automated batch

After the build/scope checkpoint, run the one repository-wide test command:

```sh
deno task test
```

This is the `deno.json` task,
`deno test --allow-read --allow-write
--allow-run=xmllint,deno --allow-net=www.irs.gov`.
It discovers all repository tests, including Form 1040 calculations,
source-to-return/MeF/PDF cases, ATS fixture assertions, and local `xmllint`
cases against `Return1040.xsd`. Record the commit, timestamp, Deno version,
exact pass/fail/ignored totals, every failure and every ignored test. Fix
failures and rerun the same full command; focused tests may help diagnose a
failure but cannot replace the final full batch. Do not use `--force` or
`--draft` to make an export pass.

The historically reported 48 intentionally ignored tests in
`forms/f1040/2025/pdf/forms/all-descriptors.test.ts` fetch the live IRS PDF for
each descriptor and verify mapped AcroForm field names. They do not run in
`deno task test` (the current number may differ after descriptor additions).
Either enable and pass those checks against the applicable canonical PDFs, or
record a reviewed per-descriptor exception. Zero failing tests with ignored
live-PDF checks is not complete PDF validation.

## XML evidence

For each supported positive filing route in the completed coverage inventory,
retain its full-return source fixture, computed 1040/supporting lines, emitted
XML, and the local XSD result. Existing `*.xsd.test.ts` and
`forms/f1040/e2e/xsd_validation.test.ts` are structural cases, but a passing
slice does not establish every listed route. A separately generated full Form
1040 XML can be checked with:

```sh
xmllint --noout --schema .state/research/docs/IMF_Series_2025v5.4/1040x_Schema_2025v5.4/2025v5.4/IndividualIncomeTax/Ind1040/Return1040.xsd /absolute/path/to/return1040.xml
```

That command is for an XML artifact after it exists, not a substitute for
source-to-return assertions or IRS business-rule review. Do not use an ATS
scenario packet PDF as if it were a generated return.

## Filled-PDF visual review

The workspace has blank IRS PDF templates in `.state/field-dumps/cache` and
source ATS scenario PDFs in `.state/research/docs/ats-ty2025`. These are not
filled-output fixtures. `forms/f1040/2025/pdf/review-fixtures.ts` now holds
twelve synthetic source returns, and `scripts/generate-ty2025-pdf-review.ts` can
run them through the real return graph and PDF builder. On 2026-09-29, all twelve
generated successfully. The 61-page PDFs, source/pending JSON, page-count and
SHA-256 manifest and native XML are retained locally at
`.state/research/ty2025-filled-pdf-review/2026-09-29-v5/`; all twelve XML
returns validate against TY2025 v5.4 `Return1040.xsd`; see the
[first review notes](ty2025-filled-pdf-review-2026-09-29.md). This is a starting
review batch, not the completed PDF gate. The generator refuses to overwrite an
existing output directory and stops on executor diagnostics. Rerun it after
changes using a new output directory:

```sh
deno run --allow-read --allow-write --allow-net=www.irs.gov scripts/generate-ty2025-pdf-review.ts /absolute/new/review-directory
```

Each case writes a filled PDF and a JSON record of its synthetic source,
identity, expected forms, review focus and raw computed pending data. The six
original cases plus six source-backed filing paths are a starting matrix, not
coverage of all registered PDF descriptors:

| Synthetic case                           | Target visual evidence                                                                                             |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `single-w2-refund`                       | Two 1040 pages, Single and digital-assets No checkboxes, wages, withholding and refund                             |
| `single-child-unearned-income`           | 1040, Schedule B, and Form 8615; parent MFJ status and the $412 Form 8615/1040 line 16 join                         |
| `joint-two-w2s`                          | MFJ and spouse identity, combined W-2 amounts without duplicate pages                                              |
| `single-schedule-c`                      | Schedule C page order and business boxes, Schedule SE/1/2, Form 8995, Form 1040 amount owed                        |
| `single-direct-pension-rollover`         | 1040 lines 5a/5b and affirmative line 5c rollover box, with no inferred QCD                                        |
| `single-hsa-code2-excess`                | Form 8889 lines 14a/14b/14c, Schedule 1 line 8z earnings, and Form 1040 line 8                                     |
| `joint-two-hsa-owners`                   | Two separately identified Form 8889 pages, Schedule 1 and Form 1040 deduction reconciliation                       |
| `single-marketplace-aptc-repayment`      | Form 8962 two-page monthly PTC calculation, one 1095-A policy, capped excess APTC through Schedule 2 and Form 1040 |
| `single-iso-amt`                         | Form 3921 ISO spread on Form 6251 line 2i, both AMT pages and any Schedule 2/Form 1040 tax join                    |
| `single-nonparticipating-rental-loss`    | Schedule E loss, Form 8582 Part V/worksheet rows, three-page order and no unsupported current loss deduction       |
| `single-elected-lump-sum-part-ii`        | Form 4972 Part-II-only capital-gain election from a matching 1099-R; ordinary share and special tax on Form 1040   |
| `single-foreign-interest-current-excess` | Source-joined 1099-INT, standard-deduction Form 1116 Part I/III/IV, current-year excess Schedule B, Schedule 3     |

The first eleven cases were rendered into page contact sheets for the first visual
pass. The new Form 8615 page was rendered and checked at higher resolution.
Schedule 1 and Schedule 2 blank filer headers were found and fixed;
the latest Schedule 1 page was rerendered and checked at higher resolution.
The Schedule E loss case now uses its linked Form 8582 allowed-loss allocation
to print line 22 and line 26, with the disallowed amount absent from Schedule
1. The first pass checked page order, form/year, visible identity, and major
amount placement. A per-page source-to-XML amount/checkbox review is still
needed, so this is not a completed visual signoff. The
`single-marketplace-aptc-repayment` source is one supported policy; it does not
cover shared-policy allocations, interstate moves, multiple policies or
same-state alternating policy years. The rental case does not cover prior PAL
imports, active-rental allowances or entire dispositions. The ISO case does not
cover the other Form 6251 adjustments or Part III preferential-rate
combinations. The Form 4972 case covers one taxpayer's full-share Part II
election only; it does not cover Part III, NUA, beneficiary/estate allocations,
separate spouse forms or multiple elected distributions. The Form 1116 case
covers one passive interest source and a reviewed 2024 zero-carryback position
only; it does not cover mixed income, multiple payers or countries, itemized
deductions, or prior carryover use.

Do not claim general Form 1116 Schedule B filled-output coverage from this
one-source fixture. The public
`form1116_review.single_source_pdf_review` intake now joins the one-source
parent Form 1116 and Schedule B to a synthetic 1099-INT and prior-year review,
Both Schedule B pages and the parent Form 1116 now generate through the public
graph and were viewed in the contact sheets; the detailed cross-check is still
open. Do not inject calculated pending values or silently drop the parent page.
The remaining registered descriptors also need
representative filled-output fixtures before this visual gate can close.

Expand this matrix to every supported active PDF route in the final coverage
inventory, including multi-page/overflow, multiple owner copies, checkbox or
radio, zero/negative amount and attachment cases. A failed generator case is a
batch failure to diagnose, not a reason to drop that fixture or use `--force`.
Keep real taxpayer data out of validation artifacts.

For each generated PDF, inspect every page beside the corresponding canonical
IRS form. Check form/year, taxpayer and spouse identity, line amounts,
checkboxes, row placement, page order, continuations, clipping, legibility,
duplicate/missing pages, and equality with computed lines and XML. Record a
result per descriptor and preserve the PDF, source fixture and review notes. For
an existing generated PDF, rasterize its pages for visual inspection with:

```sh
pdfinfo /absolute/path/to/filled-return.pdf
pdftoppm -f 1 -l 1 -png -r 150 /absolute/path/to/filled-return.pdf /absolute/path/to/review-page
```

Render all pages, not just page 1, when performing the actual review. The CLI's
`return export --type pdf` needs an existing return ID in its local store; no ID
should be selected from `.state/returns` without confirming that it is a
synthetic validation fixture. Do not use `--force` or `--draft` for a
filing-readiness claim. A PDF map test or blank template inspection is not a
filled-PDF visual check.

## Completion record

The gate stays open until the automated full batch passes on the final commit,
all expected TY2025 XSD cases execute and pass, supported positive routes have
source-to-output XML evidence, ignored live-PDF field checks are resolved, and
every active PDF route has an actual filled-file visual review. IRS
business-rule review and accepted ATS acknowledgments remain separate gates;
neither is established by local tests or rendering. Only after those and the
scope/coverage decisions are complete should PR, merge and release review begin.
